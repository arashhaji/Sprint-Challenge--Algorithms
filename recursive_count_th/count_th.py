Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

returning the length of a word set character les than two or zero if th does not exist 
define what I am looking for in th in lower case 
I only want to have two characters

if its just a individual character return nothing 
I can multiple the th together in one word by just adding it to the count 1 at a time or 2 at the time
